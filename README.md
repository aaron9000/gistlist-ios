GistList iOS
========

GistList is a GitHub-integrated task manager for iOS. It keeps your task list synchronized and versioned with Gist. Because your task list is stored in markdown, it's both viewable & editable from your browser. Simply navigate to your Gists and your task list will be there. If you like the app, consider starring the repository.
